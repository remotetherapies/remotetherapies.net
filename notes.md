## 1.1 The general theory we work with

### 1.1.1 Polyvagal theory

Main points

* The brain and the body are inextricably linked.

* The brain receives information from the body especially the principal organs and more specifically the heart. It also sends signals down to the body particularly the heart and the gut and responds to the needs of the body - in particular, the need for survival.

* To do this it constantly scans our external environment and the environment within the body and the bodies of those we interact with. It does this through an intrinsic process developed over the period of our evolution that is called neuroception. Neuroception even in infants is immediate;

* To get a feel for the speed at which neuroception takes place you may want to look at this video at one quarter the normal speed from 1m 06s to 1m 08 secs and you will see the baby responds in less than one second to the expression on the mother's face. The actual time is 0.4 seconds. https://www.youtube.com/watch/apzXGEbZht0

* This means that there is no thinking involved or analysis which changes the expression on the baby's face from playfulness to fear that something has gone wrong. What is taking place is called Neuroception. Before I start working with anyone we have a 2-3 hour session where we introduce and explain Neuroception and other key issues underlying the Polyvagal Theory.

## 1.2 Diagnoses we deal with at RemoteTherapies.net

### 1.2.1 ASD

What is Autism Spectrum Disorder?

The United Stages Centers for Disease Control and Prevention contains a [comprehensive description of ASD](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/facts.html). Some of the contents are reproduced below in italics:

You can learn more [facts](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/facts.html)

ASD is a developmental disability

People with ASD can range from the gifted to the severely challenged

Some will need more help while others will need less help in their daily lives.Symptoms include social, communication and behavioral challenges

My personal view is that the statement about there being no cure for ASD is not entirely accurate. It is correct that SSP does not cure the problem but it does have the potential to transform a child or young adult impacted by ASD into a full social and functional human being. Different individuals will achieve different levels of improvement.

#### How to recognise ASD ?

Children with ASD might 

* not point at objects to show interest (for example, not point at an airplane flying over)

* not look at objects when another person points at them

* have trouble relating to others or not have an interest in other people at all

* avoid eye contact and want to be alone

* have trouble understanding other people's feelings or talking about their own feelings

* prefer not to be held or cuddled, or might cuddle only when they want to

* appear to be unaware when people talk to them, but respond to other sounds

* be very interested in people, but not know how to talk, play, or relate to them

* repeat or echo words or phrases said to them, or repeat words or phrases in place of normal language

* have trouble expressing their needs using typical words or motions

* not play “pretend” games (for example, not pretend to “feed” a doll)

* repeat actions over and over again

* have trouble adapting when a routine changes

* have unusual reactions to the way things smell, taste, look, feel, or sound

* lose skills they once had (for example, **stop saying words** they were using)

#### Challenges

More than anything else the child affected by ASD often becomes a source of significant disruption in the household

#### Solutions

Removing the sense of fear by changing the environment around the child and within the child.

1.2.2 Conditions related to the functioning of the autonomic nervous system

* Many rare diseases

* Pre-term infants

* Parkinsons Disease

* Developmental delays

* Stress leading to strain

* PreSurgical treatment

* Corporate managers stress

1.2.3 Areas where the SSP intervention has been found to be useful

* ASD

* Trauma

* Fibromalgia

* Chronic Pain in the elderly

* Misophonia

* Selective mutism

* Anxiety

* Disassociative Identity Disorder

* Stroke even long after the event.

* Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (Concussion)

* Motion Sickness

* Tinnitus

* Parkinsons Disease

* ADHD for better resilience

* Prader Willi Syndrome

* Reactive attachment disorder

* Infants latching issues

This list is being extended over time.

### 1.2.4 Broad categories that we work with

1. Children

   * the younger the child the more the child will benefiit from the SSP. Wonderful results have been obtained by some therapists with babies on the one hand and adolescents on the other.

   * infants who have problems feeding or otherwise regulating their own behaviour. This may apply often to children born through IVF, Cesarean section or where the mother has experienced much stress during pregnancy.

   * school children in the bottom 1/3rd of the class

   * children with developmental delays

2. Executives managing more than 10 workers and responsible for the quality of their performance

3. Anyone who needs an independent assessment of the impact of a medical or therapeutic intervention

This could include patients undergoing various interventions e.g. new medications, new processes e.g. post surgery etc to monitor the trend patterns.

4. Anyone about to undergo surgery

Surgeons often indicate that the state in which the patient is when he enters anaesthesia influences the quality and duration of recovery.

5. Anyone who wants to keep track of their health in terms of ANS indices

## 1.3 How we work with clients

The therapeutic sessions typically commence with a 2-3 hour online seminar where we introduce the Polyvagal Theory and the modalities of treatment.

### 1.3.1 Broad approach

* The Autonomous Nervous System decides how our brain will manage the functions of our organs particularly the heart and the gut as well as regulating our enteric nervous system.

* It does this by receiving signals from the organs via the Vagus nerve and sending control signals to the organs via the same nerve.

* The signals it sends are affected by our sense of safety. If we experience a threat - internal or external - we need energy to meet that threat. The ANS provides the energy by increasing the heart rate. We also need other sources of energy such as hormones like Cortisol which increase the sugar in our bloodstream. At the same time our breath gets faster so we can absorb more oxygen. All these benefits are short lived. Neither Cortisol nor high heart rates nor short breathing periods assist our health in the longer term.

* We use proprietory methods to obtain an index of autonomic health to keep track of your health and to select the intervention we will use and monitor

Our interventions fall into the following categories

* Mindfulness

* Engineered sounds

* [Safe and Sound](https://integratedlistening.com/ssp-safe-sound-protocol/)

Bio Feedback in real time 

* Heart rate variability indicators

* Respiratory indicators

* Temperature

Measurements are used for:

* diagnostics

* Monitoring assessment of progress

## 1.4 How do we measure trends

### 1.4.1 Remote operation

Respiratory Profiling (RP)

* various types of RPs

* Feedback to caregivers

– Example: 

### 1.4.2 For clients with appointment

* Heart Rate Variability- Real time biofeedback

* Respiratory profiling - Real time biofeedback

* Peripheral Temperatore feedback - Real time biofeedback

## 1.5 Endorsements

### 1.5.1 Research

"Samar and his colleagues are doing tremendously innovative clinical/research work!" - Jason Tafler, CEO, Unyte - ILS

Unyte-ALS is the company that provides the Safe and Sound Protocol which I use as the strongest weapon in our arsenal

### 1.5.2 ASD child

"I heard about safe and sound protocol (SSP) from one of my friend , I never thought the therapy has been so completely life changing for my son, my son has speech delay and he is hyperactive. After taking SSP from Mr.Samar singh sir he showed magnificent change within 10 days he started to interact more. His improvement has been significant. Among other things, he has grown from monosyllabic to talking in sentences to having two way dialogues with us and at school. He is now more calm and compose, understanding gone up Overall, I am glad we chose this therapy which turned out as wonders for us. I highly recommend this therapy for all the parents." - Mother of ASD child

### 1.5.3 Adopted child with early childhood trauma

"Both my husband and me have seen so much positive changes in her. She listens to us, is so much aware of her surroundings, has increased appetite, very good mood regulations. This video was taken early in the morning just before she could wake up. Think she was almost about to wake up and hence the crankiness. Her relationship with her dad has become so beautiful." - Mother of adopted child.
